CONST CYCLE_TIME IS 50.0

Input T2 IS bool
Input T1 IS bool

Input var IS real
CONST K IS 20.0
CONST H IS 30.0

req1: Globally, it is always the case that if "T1 " holds, then "var == K" holds after at most "CYCLE_TIME" time units
req2: Globally, it is always the case that if "T2" holds, then "var == H" holds for at least "CYCLE_TIME" time units

CONST time_less_than is 20.0
Input var4 is bool
Input var1 is bool
CONST time_every is 10.0



req1: After "var1" It is always the case that once "var4" becomes satisfied, it holds for less than "time_less_than" time units
req2: After "var1" It is always the case that "!var4" holds at least every "time_every" time units
